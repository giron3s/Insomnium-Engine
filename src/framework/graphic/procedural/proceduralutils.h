         * Function to generate planes with a bending angle on both
         * x and z-axis
         *
         * The angleWidth angle bends the plane around the z-axis, and can be used
         * to generate cylinder like planes.
         *
         * The angleHeight angle bends the plane around the x-axis, but in this case
         * by rotating the yz-plane around the x-axis and calculating the points. This
         * allows to bent a cylinder-like plane into a torus
         *
         * The angleRadius angle modifies the distance of the vertex to the center
         * along the z-axis. Together with angleWidth can be used to create spheres
         * when used with 2*PI.
         *
         * @param model       Model to append the bent plane to
         * @param width       Width of the plane along the x-axis. If 'angleWidth' is not
         *                    0.0 the width will be used to calculate the radius of the
         *                    curve along the x-axis. This means that width becomes the
         *                    length of the circumference on the xy-plane
         * @param height      Height of the plane along the z-axis. If 'angleHeight' is not
         *                    0.0 the height will be used to calculate the radius of the curve
         *                    along the z-axis. This means that height becomes the length
         *                    of the circumference on the zy-plane
         * @param angleWidth  Radians of the arc of circumference with length 'width', used to
         *                    calculate the curvature of the plane along the x-axis. If 2*PI
         *                    is used then a cylinder curved around the x-axis is generated
         * @param angleHeight Radians of the arc of circumference with length 'height', used
         *                    to calculate the amount of rotation around the x-axis to achieve
         *                    curvature on the z-axis. When used together with 'angleWidth'
         *                    toroidal figures can be generated. If its value is 2*PI and
         *                    the value of 'angleWidth' is 2*PI then a torus is generated
         * @param angleRadius Affects the maximum radius from the vertices to the center of
         *                    the figure. If 0.0 all vertices have same distance to the xz-plane.
         *                    If higher than 0.0 then the farther a vertex is from the center,
         *                    the closer it will be to the xz-plane. With a value of 2*PI along
         *                    a value of 2*PI for 'angleWidth' a sphere will be generated
